# Axiom Zen - Front End Dev / Design Challenge

- How long did the assignment take?
- Did you learn anything new in the process?
- What was the hardest part?
- If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

## The Challenge

Design a landing page for the non-profit organization of your choice.

The outcome should be a high fidelity mockup plus a “kicker” of your choice from the list below. Feel free to use placeholder content for features outside your focus. For example, if you aren’t focusing on Visual Design, you do not need to create a custom logo. Quality over quantity!

Provide any useful process documentation that you would like us to see as well as the assets used. The final deliverable is yours: put it on your portfolio, tweet it, share it, make something you’re proud of!
