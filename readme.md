# Axiom Zen - Front End Dev / Design Challenge

- How long did the assignment take?
    - **Answer:** Something about 4/5 hours.
- Did you learn anything new in the process?
    - **Answer:** How to use Babel to compile ES6 into ES5.
- What was the hardest part?
    - **Answer:** The shorter time that I've reserved myself to work on this Challenge.
- If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
    - **Answer:** For sure, the mostly important advice that i've give myself, is to let my project already configured, i've lost a lot o time, configuring grunt to run Babel, and at the beginning i've started using a Windows Machine but in some minutes I've realized that my Machine was not prepared for Node, Npm and the lack of Terminal in Windows is very annoying  So i went to my Macbook and the things started to get better and faster.

## The Challenge

Design a landing page for the non-profit organization of your choice.

The outcome should be a high fidelity mockup plus a “kicker” of your choice from the list below. Feel free to use placeholder content for features outside your focus. For example, if you aren’t focusing on Visual Design, you do not need to create a custom logo. Quality over quantity!

Provide any useful process documentation that you would like us to see as well as the assets used. The final deliverable is yours: put it on your portfolio, tweet it, share it, make something you’re proud of!
